# NSString-Levenshtein.h
# ======================

The Levenshtein distance is a string metric for measuring the difference between two sequences.
Informally, the Levenshtein distance between two words is the minimum number of single-character
edits (i.e. insertions, deletions or substitutions) required to change one word into the other.

Based on the implementation of the algorithms proposed in the Wikipedia "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance".

It uses CRL2DArray implementation: "https://github.com/tGilani/CRL2DArray". Thanks to tGilani.
